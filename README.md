## Philosophy

This repository documents my journey from Python fundamentals to advanced data science applications. Each section builds systematically on the previous, with practical projects that solve real problems.

Linear algebra: **complete**. Now applying that mathematical foundation to write efficient, elegant Python code.

## Current Focus

```python
current_status = {
    "phase": "Data Science Foundation",
    "primary_focus": "NumPy array operations and Pandas data manipulation",
    "current_project": "Financial data analysis pipeline",
    "next_milestone": "First Kaggle competition submission",
    "learning_style": "Build to understand, not memorize to pass"
}
```

## Learning Approach

**Theory â†’ Practice â†’ Application**

1. **Understand the fundamentals** - Why does this work?
2. **Build practical examples** - How do I implement this?
3. **Apply to real problems** - When would I use this?

No tutorial hell. No copy-paste coding. Every line written with understanding.

## Daily Practice

Consistent daily coding with focus on:
- Algorithm implementation from scratch
- Data structure manipulation
- Problem-solving patterns
- Code optimization and readability

## Resources

### Current Learning Materials
- Python Crash Course (Eric Matthes)
- Effective Python (Brett Slatkin)
- Python for Data Analysis (Wes McKinney)
- Various Kaggle Learn courses

### Tools
- **Primary**: VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Version Control**: Git with systematic commit messages
- **Testing**: pytest for code reliability
- **Environment**: Virtual environments for project isolation
